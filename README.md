Data Declaration: 
- Each instance is annotated with a yellow label indicating its scale.
- For each scale, eight instances are provided (four small-sized and four large-sized).
- Instances are named following the convention:
  instance type–instance scale–instance size–instance number.
- The first two rows contain node coordinates and the third row specifies demands.
- The first and last nodes represent depots; intermediate nodes are customers.
- The drone payload capacity is limited to 6 kg. Demands exceeding 6 kg
  are set to 10 kg and served by the truck by default.
- The final sheet provides the instance generation template.
